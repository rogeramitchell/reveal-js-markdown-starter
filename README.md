## Slide 1
- Clone the repo, `cd` to directory, then `npm install`
- Run `npm start` to view presentation on localhost
- Edit `slides.md` with the following ideas
	- 3 line returns separate horizontal slides (not including end of line)
	- 2 line returns separate vertical slides (again, not including end of line)
	- Anything after `Speaker Note:` will not appear in slides, and will appear in speaker note panel

Speaker Note:
These are notes for me when presenting. You can have this be multiple lines.
- Hit S when viewing the presentation to launch a new window
- These are the speaker notes that you have
- Blah blah blah
